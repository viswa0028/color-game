# color-game
So in this game we will be given random colored text and the text shown will be of different colors name. So the player must guess the exact name of the color rather text and the total score(if it is highest) should be stored in a pre-existing file named highscore.txt.
So the new things that we can learn from this game is 
- File handling.
- Creating colored text.
- Exception handling.
